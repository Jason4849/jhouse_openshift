Circuit Breaker
--------------

One of strong ISTIO features is Circuit Breaker that is famous because of NetflixOSS. NetflixOSS support Circuit Breaker for Java applications but ISTIO support all languages without changing codes.

This demo show that if there are many requests to Auth application more than what this application can handle, ISTIO will cut it off to prevent more serious problems.

### Clean Up Previous Demo ###
```
oc delete virtualservice auth-fault auth-retry
```

### Install Siege ###

### Script ###
- Put load with siege program
```
siege -r 2 -c 20 http://${CHAT_SERVER_HOSTNAME}/emulate?id=abc
** SIEGE 4.0.4
** Preparing 20 concurrent users for battle.
The server is now under siege...

```
Every requests are finished in 0.07 secs without errors because it returns immediately due to duplicated userId "abc"


- Apply Circuit Breaker ISTIO Policy
This ISTIO Policy cut requests when there are more than 1 request concurrently.

```
oc apply -f scripts/istio/9-0.destinationRule-auth-cb-policy-max-connection.yaml
```


- Put load with siege program
```
siege -r 2 -c 20 http://${CHAT_SERVER_HOSTNAME}/emulate?id=abc

Almost half of requests return 503 because of ISTIO Policy.


- Increase http1MaxPendingRequests from 1 to 20.
```
oc apply -f scripts/istio/9-1.destinationRule-auth-cb-policy-pending.yaml
```

- Put load with siege program
```
siege -r 2 -c 20 http://${CHAT_SERVER_HOSTNAME}/emulate?id=abc

Now, we don't get any 503 errors but it is slower than before because some requests were in queue.
