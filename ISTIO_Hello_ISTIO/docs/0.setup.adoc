Setup for Demo
--------------

In order to use demo script for istio, you need to downgrade security. There are 2 ways to make it.

- Add anyuid to system:authenticated
- Add anyuid to default/deployer in specific project

With this demo, the first way will be used.

```
$ oc login
$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-group anyuid system:authenticated
```

Update some parameter with setup file and export them as environment variables

```
$ vi setup
..
export CHAT_CLIENT_HOSTNAME="chat-client.apps.toronto.openshiftworkshop.com"
export CHAT_SERVER_HOSTNAME="chat-server-example-chat.apps.toronto.openshiftworkshop.com"
..


$ source setup
```
